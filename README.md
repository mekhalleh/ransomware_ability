# ransomware_ability

This module was created 3 years ago, when I started developing with `Metasploit-Framework`.

Since then, taboos have changed, and many tools as [PSRansom](https://github.com/JoelGMSec/PSRansom) are beginning to appear. 

I decide to make this repository public as there are now similar programs and this does not violate `Github` rules.

Initially, I had done this to make demonstrations (by infecting a VM).

From now on, and when I have time to devote to it, I will redo the code so that it is more functional (in short, there is work).
